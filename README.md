# Super Mario World JS

An incomplete project I'm using to learn and experiment with [PIXI.JS](https://github.com/pixijs).

I'm trying to recreate Super Mario World (from SNES) so that the same experiment can be had on the browser, without an emulator as an abstraction layer, so we will be re-implementing the mechanics of the game to pixel-perfect precision.

It's quite a challenge so I might not even finish it, who knows.

# Tech stack

I'm a practical guy, so this project is as simple as possible.

PIXI.JS is the module I use for rendering and the abstraction layer between the browser and the game. HTML+JS+CSS is the rest.

Super Mario World was not created by me, it is a 1990 platform game developed by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. I'm merely recreating it in a modern platform (the browser).
